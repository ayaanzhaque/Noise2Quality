# SSPWAM

This repository contains the implementation of the paper "Non-Reference, Pixel-Wise Assessment of Abdominal CT Image Quality" by Ayaan Haque, Adam Wang, and Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran.

We propose SSPWAM, a novel, self-supervised IQA model which predicts SSIM Image Quality maps from low-dose CT. We propose a self-supervised regularization task of dose-level estimation creating a multi-tasking framework to improve performance.

## Abstract

## Model

## Dataset

## Results

## Code

The code has been written in Python using the Pytorch framework. Training requries a GPU. We provide a Jupyter Notebook, which can be run in Google Colab, containing the algorithm in a usable version. Open [SSPWAM.ipynb]() and run it through. Uncomment the training cell to train the model.
